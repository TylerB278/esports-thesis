I have worked with the streamer Redmaster on multiple occasions to create more of a brand identity for him and help him promote himself to new audiences!

<br/>

Below you can see all of the works I made for Redmaster. This first section below were subscriber icons that would go to his subscribers depending on how long they were subscribed. These are required by twitch to be 72x72px so they can appear on small screens. He instructed me on how he presented himself to his audience and what the works should look like.

The next set of graphics I also made as rewards for his viewers, they are design templates for a set of digital cards he would give out as rewards.
