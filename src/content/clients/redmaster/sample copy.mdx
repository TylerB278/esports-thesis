I have worked with the streamer Redmaster on multiple occasions to create more of a brand identity for him and help him promote himself to new audiences!

Below you can see all of the works I made for Redmaster. These were all rewards that would go out to people who subscribed to his channel and engaged with his content. He instructed me on how he presented himself to his audience and what the works should look like.
